Wordrill helps you practice your foreign language vocabulary. It gives you words
to translate, corrects you if you're wrong, and teaches you extra information if 
you're right. It requires you to type the translation. Thus, it (hypothetically) 
helps you build active vocabulary.

> [!NOTE]
> New feature coming soon! Wordrill will track word-level success rate of your 
> translations and balance between learning problematic words and remembering
> the overall vocabulary.

## How to use it?

Wordrill is a command-line Python application. It requires Python 3.11 or later.

1. Install Python ([link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download))
2. Download Wordrill ([link](https://github.com/peterlenyi/wordrill))
3. Download dictionaries ([link](https://github.com/peterlenyi/wordrill-dictionaries))
4. Run `./wordrill.sh`

Once Wordrill is running, you control it by typing in the following commands:
* `/exit` ... exit the application
* `/help` ... show this help text
* `/test` ... translate words (from locale to locale)
* `/hard` ... check exact translations (in test loop)
* `/easy` ... ignore accents and case (in test loop)
